# Azul

This is an online, multiplayer version of the board game Azul. This project has no official or unofficial affiliation with the board game.

I created this because I wanted to make a game, Azul is a fantastic game, and it seemed complex enough to present fun challenges but not so complex that I'd be spending years of my life on it.

This project is still very much a work in progress.
